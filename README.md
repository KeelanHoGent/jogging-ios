# Jogging Manager (iOS)

This is an app made to help a jogging event run more smoothly. 
The setup at this event has 2 groups, one group will stay inside and register the runners to put them in the system.
The other group are the people at the finish line that need information on who is currently running and the ability to enter the results of a race into the system.

Right now the results will be written on a piece of paper and brought to the people registering the runners so they can enter the results into the web application.
The group that's at the finish line also has to come and get the most recent runner list right before every race starts.
This method made the job for the people inside much more chaotic since they had to do 2 things at once.
The group at the finish also kept having to run inside to get information from or give information to the people registering runners.

With this app the life of both groups would be easier.
The group inside would just have to focus on the registering the runners part of the event.
The group outside would just have to focus on making sure the races go smoothly, while not having to go inside as much to get or give information.

## Background

I helped this event for the first time 2 years ago when they still used an excel sheet to organise the different races and runners.
Last year I developped a web application in Angular to make the lives of everyone easier.
This helped but it still had the issues I mentioned above.
I also made an android app that helped with these problems and this iOS app will have the same functionality.
It is a little different design-wise but that's because I outgrew the desing I did on the Andoid version of the app.
